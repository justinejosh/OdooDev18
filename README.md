# ABOUT ME!
Hello! I'm Justine Josh Larona, a Computer Science Student. Aspiring to become a junior developer.

# FEATURES
This module is about Odoo server framework.
I used Python for logic, XML for structure and POSTGRESQL for database.

It offers a form that the user can use to sell their properties. This will include the property type, property tags, and other features of the property.
It also features SQL​ constraints and python constraints.
It can also interact with other modules, such as account and estate_account. This will hold the invoicing of the property so that the system will be profitable.

# Versions
